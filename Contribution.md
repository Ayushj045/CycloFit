If you are new to contributing to open source projects, the process can be quite confusing. Not to worry! To help ensure both you and the community get the most out of your contributions, we've put together the following guidelines.
# How to Contribute
If you'd like to contribute, a good place to start is by searching through the issues and pull requests to see if someone else had a similar idea or question.

# Steps to Contribute
1.Comment on the issue you want to work on (You will be assigned only one issue at a time)<br>
2.Once assigned, Fork the project.<br>
3.Clone your fork.<br> 
```xml 
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/cyclofit
```
4.Before start working, create a new branch from the current branch
```xml
git checkout -b <YOUR-NEW-BRANCH>
```
5. Work on the new branch.<br>
6. Before pushing the code, make sure:
- There should be proper code indentation after making changes in a file. You can use Ctrl+Shift+L in android studio to indent the code after making changes in a file.
- The commit message should be short, meaningful, and precise. Try not to add more than 6-7 words.
- Use `git status` to check that no extra file has been modified.

7.To actually make the commit and push it to your GitHub fork, run:
 ``` xml
  git add .	
  git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"
  git push origin {YOUR BRANCH NAME}
  ```
 8.From your forked repository, open a new pull request. In the description of the PR mention the issue that is being solved and add relevant screenshots.<br><br>
 9.Wait for the PR to merged and look out for another issues in the meantime
